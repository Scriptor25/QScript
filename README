# QSCRIPT

# Warning: I'll have to completely re-write this "documentation" because everything changed. And when I say "everything", I do mean *EVERYTHING*.

## What is QScript?

QScript is - like almost every other project on this account - a programming language. It is designed to be a toy language, with very high level capabilities. It provides the ability to read in files as well as usage in a terminal shell. The interpreter is written in Java, making it not the fastest one. It has a very functional style, so functional, that you can create objects using functions... well, kind of. If you are interested in using this, take a look or two at the [examples](src/examples). There you also find the standard functions, like ```sqrt``` in [math.qs](src/examples/math.qs) or ```printf``` in [io.qs](src/examples/io.qs).


## Why another language?

Well... i dont know either. But this one was like a way to heal my inner self from the damage done by JavaScript.

## Should I use it?

If you want to use it for a project: dont. Just for fun: definitly. Or maybe. More like dont either. The language/interpreter is in a very unstable state, meaning I will add or remove features, change the syntax and other things on the go, what makes for a very bad coding experience if every time you did something it gets unsupported again.
